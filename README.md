# OCTA Vessel Density & FAZ Segmentation

MATLAB code for analyzing OCTA images:

* **Vessel Area Density and Vessel Skeleton Density**: Computes vd in SVC and DVC layers.
* **FAZ Segmentation**: Segments Foveal Avascular Zone from OCTA scans and extracts several shape metric features.
* **Input**: OCTA images (SVC/DVC).
* **Output**: Vessel density metrics, FAZ masks and shape metric data , and overlay images.

## Usage

Run the main scripts in MATLAB, specify layer (SVC or DVC), and input image path.

## Requirements

MATLAB with Image Processing Toolbox.
